D language bindings to libgit2
==============================

These are static bindings to the [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2) library. It directly exposes the C interface. For a higher level library with an idiomatic D interface, see [dlibgit](https://github.com/s-ludwig/dlibgit).

The actual code can be found in the branches corresponding to the libgit2 release versions. This library is available as a [DUB package](http://code.dlang.org/packages/libgit2).
